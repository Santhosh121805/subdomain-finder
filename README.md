Subdomain Finder Project Outline
Purpose of the Project:

The goal of the subdomain finder project is to identify subdomains associated with a main domain (e.g., finding blog.example.com or mail.example.com for example.com). Subdomains are useful for discovering additional areas of a website that may not be immediately visible.

Setting Up the Environment:

Python Installation: Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Library Installation: Install necessary libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, and dnspython.

Creating the Script:

Python Script: Write a Python script where the logic for finding subdomains will be implemented.

Importing Libraries:

Use Python libraries such as requests for making HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and dnspython for DNS lookups.

at last to run the code we have to use the terminal and use the command "python subdomain_finder.py"
